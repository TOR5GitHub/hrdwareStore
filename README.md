## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1. Project Overview
The Event Management System is a web-based application designed to help users organize, manage, and participate in events efficiently. The system provides functionalities for both administrators and users, allowing them to create events, register for events, and view event details.

### 1.2. Objectives
- To develop a user-friendly interface for event management.
- To provide a secure and efficient backend using PHP and MySQL.
- To enable administrators to manage events and participants.
- To allow users to register for events and view event details.

## 3. EXISTING SYSTEM

### 3.1. Introduction
Existing event management systems often lack user-friendly interfaces and efficient backend systems. They may also lack features such as real-time updates and secure user authentication.

### 3.2. Existing Software
Several event management software solutions are available, but they may not meet the specific needs of all organizations. Custom solutions are often required to address unique requirements.

---

## 4. PROBLEM ANALYSIS

### 4.1. Product Definition
The Event Management System is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and participate in events. It includes features for user registration, event creation, participant management, and reporting.

### 4.2. Feasibility Analysis
The feasibility analysis includes technical, operational, and economic feasibility. The system is technically feasible as it uses widely adopted technologies such as PHP and MySQL. It is operationally feasible as it simplifies event management processes. Economically, it is feasible as it reduces the need for manual processes and associated costs.

### 4.3. Project Plan
The project plan includes the following phases:
- Requirement Analysis
- System Design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

### 4.4. Flowcharts
Flowcharts will be used to represent the workflow of the system, including user registration, event creation, and participant management.

### 4.5. Pseudo Code
Pseudo code will be provided for key functionalities such as user authentication, event creation, and participant registration.

---

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION

### 5.1. Implementation of the Project
The project is implemented using PHP for the backend and MySQL for the database. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 5.2. Conversion Plan
The conversion plan includes migrating data from existing systems to the new system and training users on how to use the new system.

### 5.3. Post-Implementation and Software Maintenance
Post-implementation activities include monitoring the system for issues, providing user support, and performing regular maintenance.

---

## 6. PROJECT LEGACY
The project legacy includes documentation, source code, and user manuals. The system is designed to be scalable and maintainable for future enhancements.

---

## 7. SOURCE CODE OR SYSTEM SNAPSHOTS
The source code and system snapshots are provided in the appendices. Key code excerpts include user authentication, event creation, and participant management.

---

## 8. CONCLUSION
